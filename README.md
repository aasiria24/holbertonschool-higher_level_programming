# Python - Hello, World

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for learning the basics of Python programming, as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project covers fundamental Python concepts including:
- Using the Python interpreter
- Printing text and variables
- Working with strings
- Indexing and slicing
- Python coding style (PEP 8)
- Using pycodestyle for code validation

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

### General
- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using `print`
- How to use strings
- What are indexing and slicing in Python
- What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with `pycodestyle`

### Technical
- Write Python scripts that follow specific requirements
- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Perform string manipulation operations
- Understand and apply Python's style guidelines

## ⚙️ Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`

### Documentation
- A README.md file at the root of the repo (this file)
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder

## 📋 Task List

1. **Print String**: Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"
2. **Print Integer**: Print the integer stored in a variable followed by "Battery street"
3. **Print Float**: Print a float with precision of 2 digits
4. **String Repetition**: Print a string 3 times followed by its first 9 characters
5. **String Concatenation**: Concatenate strings to print "Welcome to Holberton School!"
6. **String Slicing**: Extract and print first 3 letters, last 2 letters, and middle of a string
7. **Advanced Slicing**: Extract and concatenate substrings without creating new variables
8. **The Zen of Python**: Print "The Zen of Python" using Python's Easter egg

## 🔧 Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (or compatible system)

### Running the Scripts
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x script_name.py

# Run the script
./script_name.py

Checking Code Style
# Install pycodestyle if not already installed
pip install pycodestyle

# Check a file
pycodestyle script_name.py
